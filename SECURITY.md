# Security policy

This program is intended for a single-task retro 8-bit computer, the "Commander X16" with a 65C02 CPU.
(If you are not familiar with the Commander X16, you can think of it as a Commodore C64 style computer).

The program is expected to run after the Commander X16 has been turned on (reset).
Once the program is loaded and started, there are no other programs to conflict with,
as there is no operating system and no mutlitasking in Commander X16.

It is very unlikely that the Commander X16 is connected to the Internet, as it does not support a network (at least not without additional hardware and software).


Due to the limitations of the overall system, the security risks can be classified as very low.


# Security notes:

To be on the foolproof serious side:

* Only use this program on the real Hardware Commander X16.
* Keep the program on a separate SD card on which no other important data is stored.
* Do not connect the Commander X16 to a network (which is not possible by default anyway).


If the program is running on a modern PC with the 'x16emu' emulator, it depends on the security of 'x16emu' and how 'x16emu' is operated.
But this is beyond the scope of this program.

Safety instructions for the operation of DotMatrix with X16emu:

* Run x16emu in a protected environment (e.g. a virtual machine)
* Run x16emu on a computer that is not connected to a network.
* Run x16emu on a computer that does not contain any valuable data.
* Comply with all your own safety rules
* Look out for safety instructions on x16emu
* Prefer the real Hardware Commander X16
