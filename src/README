The program compiles with the cl65 compile & link utility for cc65, the 6502 series compiler.
Tested with version:
cl65 V2.19 - Git 0541b65aa

To compile move to the src directory and run 'make'.

Finished target should be 'DOTMAT.PRG'

In case you have 'x16emu' installed you may use 'make run' to compile and start the program within the emulator.
Adopt the makefile to your needs (e.g. keymapping).

Current mainfile is 'dotmatrix10.asm' (eventhough the version is V9).
