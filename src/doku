DOT MATRIX turns your screen into a 5x7 dot matrix display.
And just lets you put some letters on it.

Two modes are supported:
20*10 characters, each 32*48 pixel
or
40*20 characters, each 16*24 pixel.

Toggling between modes is done via F4.

There are 8 pages (0-7).
Use page up/down buttons to switch pages.

Every page may have its own mode and color settings.
Color settings are done in the color menu, hit F11.
Possible color settings differ denpending on mode.

F10 in the color menu sets all pages to the same mode and color.


A rudimentary sequencer lets all pages cycle, while each page may have it's own step time.
Step time is set with the F7 menu.
The F6  menu lets you activate a "sequence running" indicator shown in the lower left corner while running.
Also the page no. indicator may be activated that shows when the sequence proceeds to a next page.
Both act as reminders, that something is still running, especially when pages are still empty and look the same.
Sequence is started and stopped by F5 (ESC, F6,F7 also stopps).

Once in a menu (shown with a title bar), only the mentioned keys will work.
ESC should allways take you out.

One of the unusual things with this program is, that it shows menus in the same mode and color as the actual page.
